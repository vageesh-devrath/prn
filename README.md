# PRN
## AIM:-Enter the PRN and Display it.
### Theory:-
      The standard input-output header file, named stdio.h contains the definition of the functions printf() and scanf(), which are used to display output on screen and to take input from user respectively.
      We need to give a % symbol inside the scanf() or printf() functions. It is known as format string and this informs the scanf() function, what type of input to expect and in printf() it is used to give a heads up to the compiler, what type of output to expect.
#### Algorithm:-
          1)Start
          2)Deaclare a variable to initialize it with your PRN
          3)Display the PRN
          4)END
##### Conclusion:-
        From this program learnt to display a singlevalue using the input and output functions present in c
